----
implement command line options
--format = "format string" (default %url%)

implement sessionstorewriter
put in place of urlwriter
allurlgen > filters > sessionstorewriter
why? urlwriter writes urls to stdout (or to file)
sessionstore writes a new sessionstore.js file
use case: clear closed windows and tabs and back forward history

----
implement reading from stdin
