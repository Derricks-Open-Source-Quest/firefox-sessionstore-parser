here be todos

----
implement command line options
--format = "format string" (default %url%)

----
implement sessionstorewriter
put in place of urlwriter
allurlgen > filters > sessionstorewriter
why? urlwriter writes urls to stdout (or to file)
sessionstore writes a new sessionstore.js file
use case: clear closed windows and tabs and back forward history

----
implement reading from stdin

----
make urlfilter factory build filter in order given in argv
make parsedargv preserve order
