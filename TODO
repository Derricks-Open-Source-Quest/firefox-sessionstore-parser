here be todos

----
rewrite url generator
current: windowgen > tabgen > urlgen > urlwriter
todo: allurlgen > windowfilter > tabfilter > urlfilter > urlwriter
allurlgen will generate all urls along with all metadata relevant to each url
each filter will filter out urls
advantage: all urls with all data are available from first generator
easy to add custom filter

----
implement command line options
--window = [open, closed, all, selected] (default: open)
--tab = [open, closed, all, selected] (default: open)
--url = [back, forward, all, selected] (default: selected)
--format = "format string" (default %url%)

----
implement sessionstorewriter
put in place of urlwriter
allurlgen > filters > sessionstorewriter
why? urlwriter writes urls to stdout (or to file)
sessionstore writes a new sessionstore.js file
use case: clear closed windows and tabs and back forward history

----
redesign argvparser
argvparser should get argv without progname
unknown should be returned separately
this behaviour is closer to getopt behaviour
